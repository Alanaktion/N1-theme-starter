# N1 XP Luna
A simple Windows XP Luna theme for Nylus N1

Designed to work great with the YlmfOS GTK theme, but it would probably fit in on XP too.

## Installation
1. Download/clone this repo
2. Unzip the repo if you downloaded it
3. From N1, Edit > Install Theme...
4. Select theme folder
5. You're done!
